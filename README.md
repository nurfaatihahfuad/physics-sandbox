# ⚡ Physics Sandbox

An interactive physics sandbox inspired by Algodoo, built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Create objects, watch them interact with gravity, collisions, and various forces!

## 🎮 Features

### Core Features
- **Spawn Objects**: Create boxes, balls, and custom polygons
- **Real-time Physics**: Watch objects move, collide, and react to forces
- **Gravity Toggle**: Turn gravity on/off to see different effects
- **Drag Objects**: Interact with objects by dragging them around
- **Delete Objects**: Remove objects by clicking (hold Delete key or double-click)
- **Pause/Play**: Freeze and resume the simulation

### Advanced Features
- **Wind Force**: Toggle wind to see objects blow around
- **Explosion Force**: Create explosions that push objects away
- **Friction Adjustment**: Control air resistance and surface friction
- **Real-time Collisions**: Objects bounce off each other with realistic physics

## 🎯 Physics Concepts Demonstrated

- **Newton's Laws**: Objects in motion stay in motion, force = mass × acceleration
- **Gravity**: Constant downward acceleration affecting all objects
- **Collisions**: Elastic and inelastic collisions with momentum transfer
- **Momentum**: Conservation of momentum in object interactions
- **Friction**: Air resistance and surface friction simulation
